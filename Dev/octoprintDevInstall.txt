Go to this folder and do

Docker-compose up

It will install a BUNCH of stuff and then you should be able to navigate to octoprint running local on your own machine. This then lets us install a virtual printer and use a fully offline version of things for testing.

You should also be able to run multiple virtual octoprint installs if you really wanted to test farm functions.
